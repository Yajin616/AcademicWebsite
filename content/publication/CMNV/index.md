abstract: Due to the viral covert mortality disease (VCMD), a new disease brought on by covert mortality nodavirus (CMNV), the Litopenaeus vannamei aquaculture industry in China and Southeast Asian countries have experienced major economic losses over the past ten years. A rapid and accurate on-site pre-detection plays as the first step and a critical part in the efficient control of VCMD spreads and outbreaks. For the rapid and accurate on-site detection of CMNV, a novel real-time quantitative assay based on quantitative recombinase polymerase amplification (qRPA) was developed in this study. By optimizing the optimum primer pairs based on the conserved RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes, appropriate reaction temperatures, and probe dosages. It was possible to perform the CMNV-qRPA test at 42 °C in 20 min without exhibiting any cross-reactivity with the four major aquatic infections. Then its ability was compared to real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) as well as nested PCR assays for detection of CMNV. As results of the sensitivity tests, the limit of detection (LOD) for the CMNV-qRPA, CMNV nested PCR, and CMNV qPCR assays were 5.5 × 102 copies μL−1, 5.5 copies μL−1 and 5.5 × 102 copies μL−1, respectively. Based on these results, it is demonstrated that the CMNV-qRPA assay developed in this study is both sensitive and specific for the rapid on-site pre-diagnosis of CMNV. Those findings were also demonstrated the application potential of CMNV-qRPA assay for efficiently preventing and controlling the spread and outbreak of VCMD in the aquaculture industry and application prospect of this diagnosis method in other related fields.
