publication_short: "The aim of Aquaculture is to publish and make available the highest quality international scientific contributions concerning to aquaculture. The Journal publishes disciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary aquaculture research related to the science of aquaculture. The scope of Aquaculture includes the traditional priorities of its sections, but also includes papers from non-traditional scientific areas such as sustainability science, social-ecological systems, as well as aquaculture of various species for ornamental, conservation and restoration purposes."

abstract: Due to the viral covert mortality disease (VCMD), a new disease brought on by covert mortality nodavirus (CMNV), the Litopenaeus vannamei aquaculture industry in China and Southeast Asian countries have experienced major economic losses over the past ten years. A rapid and accurate on-site pre-detection plays as the first step and a critical part in the efficient control of VCMD spreads and outbreaks. For the rapid and accurate on-site detection of CMNV, a novel real-time quantitative assay based on quantitative recombinase polymerase amplification (qRPA) was developed in this study. By optimizing the optimum primer pairs based on the conserved RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes, appropriate reaction temperatures, and probe dosages. It was possible to perform the CMNV-qRPA test at 42 °C in 20 min without exhibiting any cross-reactivity with the four major aquatic infections. Then its ability was compared to real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) as well as nested PCR assays for detection of CMNV. As results of the sensitivity tests, the limit of detection (LOD) for the CMNV-qRPA, CMNV nested PCR, and CMNV qPCR assays were 5.5 × 102 copies μL−1, 5.5 copies μL−1 and 5.5 × 102 copies μL−1, respectively. Based on these results, it is demonstrated that the CMNV-qRPA assay developed in this study is both sensitive and specific for the rapid on-site pre-diagnosis of CMNV. Those findings were also demonstrated the application potential of CMNV-qRPA assay for efficiently preventing and controlling the spread and outbreak of VCMD in the aquaculture industry and application prospect of this diagnosis method in other related fields.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We developed a highly sensitive and specific real-time quantitative RPA assay and improved its instrument-free visualization for rapidly detecting DIV1. The LOD of the DIV1-qRPA assay reached 1.0 copies μL−1, which was higher than the LOD of qPCR and qLAMP, and the visual detecting limitation of the instrument-free DIV1-RPA-SYBR Green I assay was 1.0 × 10^3 copies/μL. Both assays could be performed at 42 °C within 20 min and had no cross-reactivity with WSSV, VpAHPND, EHP, or IHHNV. These two methods offer straightforward, eye-catching, and equipment-free approaches for DIV1 detection in shrimp farms, quarantine stations, and basic laboratories with limited resources, especially in remote and rural regions; the most appropriate method can be chosen based on the practical conditions of the testing site. Furthermore, the results of this study may promote the wide application of DIV1 detection methods based on nucleic acid amplification technology and provide a reference value for monitoring and controlling this new virus in the aquaculture industry.
