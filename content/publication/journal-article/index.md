abstract: In this study, a novel real-time quantitative recombinase polymerase amplification (qRPA) assay and its instrument-free visualization improvement were described for the rapid detection of DIV1. Optimum primer pairs, suitable reaction temperatures, and probe concentrations of a DIV1-qRPA assay were screened to determine optimal reaction conditions. Then, its ability to detect DIV1 was evaluated and compared with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCRs). The sensitivity tests demonstrated that the limit of detection (LOD) of the DIV1-qRPA assay was 1.0 copies/μL. Additionally, the presentation of the detection results was improved with SYBR Green I, and the LOD of the DIV1-RPA-SYBR Green I assay was 1.0 × 10^3 copies/μL. Both the DIV1-qRPA and DIV1-RPA-SYBR Green I assays could be performed at 42 °C within 20 min and without cross-reactivity with other common pathogens.
