abstract: In this study, a novel real-time quantitative recombinase polymerase amplification (qRPA) assay and its instrument-free visualization improvement were described for the rapid detection of DIV1. Optimum primer pairs, suitable reaction temperatures, and probe concentrations of a DIV1-qRPA assay were screened to determine optimal reaction conditions. Then, its ability to detect DIV1 was evaluated and compared with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCRs).

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We developed a highly sensitive and specific real-time quantitative RPA assay and improved its instrument-free visualization for rapidly detecting DIV1. The LOD of the DIV1-qRPA assay reached 1.0 copies μL−1, which was higher than the LOD of qPCR and qLAMP, and the visual detecting limitation of the instrument-free DIV1-RPA-SYBR Green I assay was 1.0 × 103 copies μL−1. Both assays could be performed at 42 °C within 20 min and had no cross-reactivity with WSSV, VpAHPND, EHP, or IHHNV. These two methods offer straightforward, eye-catching, and equipment-free approaches for DIV1 detection in shrimp farms, quarantine stations, and basic laboratories with limited resources, especially in remote and rural regions; the most appropriate method can be chosen based on the practical conditions of the testing site. Furthermore, the results of this study may promote the wide application of DIV1 detection methods based on nucleic acid amplification technology and provide a reference value for monitoring and controlling this new virus in the aquaculture industry.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We developed a highly sensitive and specific real-time quantitative RPA assay and improved its instrument-free visualization for rapidly detecting DIV1. The LOD of the DIV1-qRPA assay reached 1.0 copies μL^−1, which was higher than the LOD of qPCR and qLAMP, and the visual detecting limitation of the instrument-free DIV1-RPA-SYBR Green I assay was 1.0 × 10^3 copies μL^−1. Both assays could be performed at 42 °C within 20 min and had no cross-reactivity with WSSV, VpAHPND, EHP, or IHHNV. These two methods offer straightforward, eye-catching, and equipment-free approaches for DIV1 detection in shrimp farms, quarantine stations, and basic laboratories with limited resources, especially in remote and rural regions; the most appropriate method can be chosen based on the practical conditions of the testing site.
