## Multiple Sequence Alignment using DNAman

- **Import Sequences:** Open DNAman and import the sequences you want to align. Go to "File" -> "Import" and select your sequences from the file system.
  
- **Select Multiple Alignment:** Look for the option to perform a multiple sequence alignment. It might be under an "Align" or "Multiple Alignment" menu.

- **Adjust Parameters:** Set alignment parameters like gap penalties and similarity matrices if applicable.

- **Perform Alignment:** Initiate the alignment process. DNAman will align the sequences according to the settings provided.

- **Review and Edit Alignment:** After alignment, review the results. DNAman will likely display the aligned sequences. Check for conserved regions, gaps, and mismatches. You might be able to edit the alignment manually if necessary.
  
- **Save Results:** Save the alignment in a compatible format like FASTA.
  
## Visualization using GeneDoc

- **Open GeneDoc and Import Alignment:** Launch GeneDoc and import the alignment file you saved from DNAman. Go to "File" -> "Open" and select your alignment file.
  
- **Visualize Alignment:** GeneDoc will display the alignment in a table format. Review the alignment to identify patterns, conserved regions, and gaps.

- **Customize Display:** Adjust the display settings like color schemes, fonts, and annotations to enhance visualization. This might be under options like "View" or "Display Settings".

- **Manual Editing (if needed):** If there are specific regions you want to modify or annotate, GeneDoc may allow for manual editing. Look for options related to editing or annotations.

 - **Save/Export:** Save the modified alignment in a format compatible with your downstream analysis or publication needs.
