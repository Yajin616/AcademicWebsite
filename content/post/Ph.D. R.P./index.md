## Tips

Be clear and specific about your research questions, methods, and expected outcomes.
Highlight the novelty of your research and how it contributes to the field.
Ensure that your research proposal aligns with the research interests of the program and potential supervisors.
Each institution might have its specific requirements, check their guidelines or sample proposals if available.
Discuss your proposal with your potential supervisor or mentors.
Revise and refine your proposal multiple times. 

## Sections

- **Title**

  Provide a clear and concise title that reflects the focus of your research proposal.
  
- **Abstract**
  
  Summarize your entire proposal in a concise manner (typically 200-300 words).
  
  Include the research question, objectives, methodology, and potential outcomes.
  
  Don't forget to list keywords.
  
  (My personal suggestion is to write this part after completing the entire research proposal.)

- **Introduction**
  
  Provide an overview of the research problem, its significance, and the broader context in your research field.

  State your research question and objectives clearly.

- **Literature Review**

  Summarize relevant literature to establish the context and justify your research.

  Identify gaps in existing knowledge that your research will address.

  Cite key studies, theories, and findings.

- **Research Objectives and Hypotheses/Questions**
  
  Clearly define the specific objectives or hypotheses your research aims to address.
  
  Formulate research questions that align with your objectives.

- **Methodology**
  
  Describe the research methods and techniques you plan to use.
  
  Justify the choice of these methods, explaining why they are appropriate for your research.
  
  Include details on data collection, sample size, experimental design, statistical analyses, and any other relevant information.
  
- **Expected Outcomes and Significance**
  
  Explain the potential outcomes of your research.
  
  Discuss the significance of your research in the broader context of biology and its potential impact on the field.

- **Research Plan and Timeline** -
  
  Provide a detailed timeline indicating the sequence of activities and milestones.
  
  Specify the estimated time for each task, such as literature review, data collection, analysis, and writing.
  
- **Budget and Resources**
  
  List the resources you will need, including laboratory equipment, materials, software, and any necessary funding.

  Explain how you plan to obtain these resources.
  
  - **References**
  
  Include a comprehensive list of all the sources cited in your proposal, following a consistent citation style (e.g., APA, MLA, or the style recommended by your institution).

  - **Appendices (if necessary)**
  
  Attach any additional documents, such as survey questionnaires, permits, or supplementary information.
  
## Notes
Remember, your doctoral research proposal is a crucial document that should convince your academic committee of the feasibility and significance of your research project. It should be well-structured, well-reasoned, and persuasively written. Good luck with your research proposal!
