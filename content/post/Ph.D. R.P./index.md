## Important Notes

Be clear and specific about your research questions, methods, and expected outcomes.
Highlight the novelty of your research and how it contributes to the field.
Ensure that your research proposal aligns with the research interests of the program and potential supervisors.
Each institution might have its specific requirements, check their guidelines or sample proposals if available.
Discuss your proposal with your potential supervisor or mentors.
Revise and refine your proposal multiple times. 

## Sections

- **Title:**

  Provide a clear and concise title that reflects the focus of your research proposal.
  
- **Abstract:**
  
  Summarize your entire proposal in a concise manner.
  
  Include the research question, objectives, methodology, and potential outcomes.
  
  Don't forget to list keywords.
  
  My personal suggestion is to write this part after completing the entire research proposal.

- **Contents:**
  
   a. Primer Length: RPA primers are typically 30-35 nucleotides in length.
  
   b. GC Content: Aim for a GC content of 30-60%.
  
   c. Tm (Melting Temperature): Calculate the Tm of primers to ensure they have similar melting temperatures.
  
   d. Avoid Self-Complementarity: Check for self-complementarity and primer-dimer formation.
  
   e. Target Proximity: Place primers 100-300 base pairs apart for optimal amplification.
  
   f. Include RPA Excluder: Incorporate an RPA excluder sequence at the 5' end of one primer to prevent amplification of non-target sequences.

- **Probe Design:**
  
  a. Probe Type: RPA-LFD often uses a probe for detecting the amplified product. Consider using a fluorescent probe or a biotin-labeled probe.
  
  b. Positioning: Design the probe to bind specifically within the amplified region.
  
  c. Length: Typically, RPA-LFD probes are 20-25 nucleotides in length.
  
  d. Quencher: Use a quencher molecule to reduce background signal.
  
  e. Fluorophore: Attach a fluorophore at the 5' end for signal detection in fluorescent-based LFD assays.
  
  f. Biotinylation: If using a biotin-labeled probe, ensure biotin is incorporated at the 5' or 3' end.

- **Cross-Reactivity Assessment:** Perform in silico analysis to check for potential cross-reactivity with non-target sequences. Tools like BLAST can help identify potential issues.
  
- **Testing and Validation:** Design and test multiple primer and probe sets in the lab to identify the most effective combination. Use positive and negative controls to validate the assay's specificity and sensitivity.

- **Modifications for LFD:** - Modify the probe for LFD detection by adding a capture antibody and visualization reagents. The interaction between the probe and the capture antibody will produce a visible signal on the LFD.
  
- **Optimize Reaction Conditions:** Optimize the RPA-LFD reaction conditions, including temperature, time, and reagent concentrations, to achieve the best results.
  
## Good luck with your research proposal!
