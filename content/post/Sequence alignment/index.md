## Multiple Sequence Alignment using DNAman

- **Import Sequences:** Open DNAman and import the sequences you want to align. Go to "File" -> "Import" and select your sequences from the file system.
  
- **Select Multiple Alignment:** Look for the option to perform a multiple sequence alignment. It might be under an "Align" or "Multiple Alignment" menu.

- **Adjust Parameters:** Set alignment parameters like gap penalties and similarity matrices if applicable.

- **Perform Alignment:** Initiate the alignment process. DNAman will align the sequences according to the settings provided.

- **Review and Edit Alignment:** After alignment, review the results. DNAman will likely display the aligned sequences. Check for conserved regions, gaps, and mismatches. You might be able to edit the alignment manually if necessary.
  
- **Save Results:** Save the alignment in a compatible format like FASTA.
  
## Visualization using GeneDoc

- **Open GeneDoc and Import Alignment:** Launch GeneDoc and import the alignment file you saved from DNAman. Go to "File" -> "Open" and select your alignment file.
  
- **Visualize Alignment:** GeneDoc will display the alignment in a table format. Review the alignment to identify patterns, conserved regions, and gaps.

- **Customize Display:** Adjust the display settings like color schemes, fonts, and annotations to enhance visualization. This might be under options like "View" or "Display Settings".

- **Manual Editing (if needed):** If there are specific regions you want to modify or annotate, GeneDoc may allow for manual editing. Look for options related to editing or annotations.

 - **Save/Export:** Save the modified alignment in a format compatible with your downstream analysis or publication needs.

## Neighbor-Joining trees

- **Data Input:** Launch the MEGA software on your computer. Go to "File" -> "Open Data File" to import your sequence data in formats like FASTA, GenBank, or MEGA file format.
  
- **Constructing Tree:**
  
   * Go to "Phylogeny" -> "Construct/Test Phylogenetic Tree".
     
   * Select "Neighbor-Joining" as the tree-building method.
     
   * Choose a substitution model suitable for your dataset. Commonly used models include Jukes-Cantor, Kimura 2-parameter, or Tamura-Nei.
     
   * Estimate the rates of variation among sites if applicable.
   
   * Perform bootstrap analysis to assess the reliability of branches. Choose the number of bootstrap replicates (e.g., 1000) to generate resampled datasets and compute consensus trees.
   
   * Click on the "Compute" or "Run" button to start constructing the neighbor-joining tree.

- **Tree Visualization and Analysis:** Once the tree is generated, it will be displayed in the main window. Explore the tree using different viewing options (e.g., zoom, node labels) to examine evolutionary relationships. Evaluate the support values at the nodes if you performed bootstrapping. Higher values indicate stronger support for specific branches.

- **Saving and Exporting:** Save the constructed tree in a compatible format (e.g., Newick format) for further analysis or visualization. Export the tree image or copy it for use in presentations, reports, or publications.
